## Description
Code Typewriter is a game heavily inspired by TypeWriter, in which the user is prompted with a code snippet, and then timed by how fast they type the code snippet without error. Often times when playing games like TypeRacer, the Word Per Minute doesn't accurately show how fast you would type when coding, because of weird characters one deals with when coding. This is why Code TypeWriter was made. Built in React, FastAPI, and FaunaDB, this game is simple to play and great for working on your typing speed.
